AI Solution Engineer & Technical Leader based in Haarlem area, Netherlands.

Problem solver with a background in experimental physics, trained in first-principles thinking across complex technical challenges. I work hands-on, pragmatically, focused on what actually ships.

I build end-to-end AI/ML solutions from research through production deployment. My work spans top-tier research institutes and industry environments, where I've led teams through technical product development — balancing what's technically feasible with what the business actually needs. I focus on building autonomous teams where people can do their best work and products scale sustainably.

## Principles

### Product
- Ship early, learn fast — perfect is the enemy of shipped
- Build for the user, not for the tech
- Measure what matters, automate what doesn't

### Engineering
- Simple > clever — write code your future self can read
- The best fix is a deletion — if removing code solves the problem, you found the right layer
- Production-first — if it can't run reliably, it doesn't count
- LLM-first — design workflows where AI assists, not replaces

### AI/ML
- Start with the simplest model that could work
- Data quality beats model complexity
- Always have a baseline to compare against
- Make it easy to experiment, hard to break production

### Teams
- Trust and autonomy over process and control
- Teach people to fish — coaching > doing it yourself
- Strong opinions, loosely held
- Feedback is a gift — give it early, receive it openly

### Decisions
- Reversible decisions fast, irreversible decisions carefully
- Default to action — bias towards trying over planning
- If it went wrong once, prevent it forever
